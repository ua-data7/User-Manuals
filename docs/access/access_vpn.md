The typable field will allow you to type any VPN host associated to the University of Arizona. By default, you should be able to select *UA SSL VPN*. However, in order to connect to the Soteria VPN, you will need to insert the following URL: **vpn.arizona.edu/soteria**. In the future, the field should autopopulate to **Soteria**. Upon clicking **Connect** a second window will open, where you can insert your UA NetID, Password and NetID +Method (e.g.,: "push") to sign in.

??? Tip "First time connecting to Soteria and having trouble? You may have to connect to the UA VPN." 
    
    In the typable field, type **vpn.arizona.edu** and Connect. Follow the connection instructions and establish connection first. Then disconnect from the UA VPN, and then connect to the Soteria VPN. Cisco *might* need to establish the connection first.

When you see the following popup, **accept** the message and you will be connected to the Soteria enclave.

The Cisco VPN icon will show a lock in front, meaning that the connection is working, secured and metered. You can now proceed to using he various services within the safe Soteria enclave!
