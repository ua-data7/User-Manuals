# Background

Posit Connect (formerly known as RStudio Connect) is a tool that allows for organizational sharing of items published from RStudio such as [Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), interactive graphs and reporting documents (such as this one created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). This document is intended to walk RStudio users through the process of establishing an Posit Connect account, connecting to Posit Connect from RStudio, and publishing a document to Posit Connect.

To access Posit Connect Health however, you will first need to have access to the Soteria enclave.

# Request Access to Soteria

1.  Establish a primary PI or sponsoring faculty member and have them indicate that you are a team member on Soteria.
2.  Open <https://soteria.arizona.edu/> and click **Request Access**.
