**Soteria** is a secure and collaborative platform designed for health sciences research. It enables researchers to analyze personally identifiable and protected health information while adhering to compliance guidelines. By providing cutting-edge software and web-based applications, Soteria ensures data security throughout the research lifecycle, allowing multiple research groups to work together effectively while meeting regulatory requirements.

## Soteria: A Comprehensive Overview

Soteria stands as a pivotal innovation in secure data analysis, providing a robust platform specifically designed for research involving [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii) and [Protected Health Information (PHI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553131/). Recognizing the critical importance of privacy and security, Soteria offers a specialized enclave that champions compliance, control, and confidentiality throughout the research process.

Key features of Soteria include its stringent access protocols, ensuring that only authorized researchers can engage with the sensitive data within. This is overseen by the [Soteria Access & Governance Committee](https://arizona.box.com/s/cyjgo0evur1bjlo44iz2ne6py0srys58) (UA ID required to access the document), a dedicated body ensuring adherence to legal and ethical standards. The platform's unique blend of resources and tools, including the cutting-edge Soteria HPC, External Data Transfer, and Posit Connect Health, are customized to meet the demands of secure, efficient, and collaborative research.

By encapsulating all these features, Soteria emerges as more than just a platform; it's a safeguard for sensitive information, a facilitator of interdisciplinary research, and a beacon of trust in the realm of data security.
