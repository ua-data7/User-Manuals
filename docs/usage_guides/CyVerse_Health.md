* For handling large files or datasets, iCommands or Cyberduck are recommended for better performance.

### Accessing CyVerse Data via WebDAV Services

**1. Anonymous, Read-Only Access:**
URL: https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/
This service provides access to all data visible to the anonymous user, except for directories like /iplant/home and individual user home directories.

**2. Authenticated Access:**
URL: https://data.cyverse.org/dav/
After authenticating with CyVerse credentials, users can access any file or folder according to their permission levels.

**3. Access via Web Browser:**
Navigate to https://data.cyverse.org/ to access WebDAV through a browser interface.
This portal provides direct links and guidance for both anonymous and authenticated access modes.

**4. Using WebDAV in File Managers:**
WebDAV can be integrated into file managers of common operating systems, enabling drag-and-drop functionality and seamless file copying between the Data Store and local folders.

**5. Command Line Tools:**
WebDAV services can also be accessed using command line tools for users who prefer terminal-based interactions.
